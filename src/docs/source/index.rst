papyrus-retrieval documentation
===============================

This web application is developed as part of my master's program coursework. It focuses on image retrieval, specifically designed to find and retrieve similar papyrus images.

Notably, the architecture and libraries used enable this web app to scale efficiently to handle hundreds of thousands of images, making it suitable for large-scale image retrieval applications across various domains.
